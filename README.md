# [JSONPath] for Dart
Jessie is a work-in-progress. Expect the API to change often. Feel free to join.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Basic selectors: fields, indices
- [ ] Recursive descent (`..`)
- [ ] Wildcard (`*`)
- [ ] Subscript (`[:2]`)
- [ ] Slice (`[1:10:2]`)
- [ ] Union (`book[0, 1]`, `book[author, title, price]`)
- [ ] Basic filtering (`book[?(@.price - 1)]`)
- [ ] Expressions?
